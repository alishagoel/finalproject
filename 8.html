	<h2>This how it feels when <span class="spanColor"> WE </span> make websites inaccessible for people with special needs.</h2>
	<h2 class="stats">As of 2023, 90% of websites are inaccessible to people with disabilities who use assistive technology.</h2>
	<h2 class="stats">96.8% of websites had detectable WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) failures.</h2>
	<div class="issues">
	<h2 class="spanColor">Some common issues are: </h2>
	<br>
	<p><b>Low color contrast text: </b><br>
	Remember Evidence 1 with low contrast color yellow text on the scroll? People with low vision and color blindness struggle to read website content and elements on these web pages with low color contrast. A lot of websites use gray colored text on white background for aesthethic purposes, however, it makes text harder for people with  vision disabilites to read. A standard metric that meets website contrast accessibility requirement is 4:5:1, which can easily be checked by online color checkers.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Lack of audio transcripts: </b><br>Like the voicemail found for Evidence 2, a lot of people with hearing disabilities have trouble understanding words in auditory mediums online. To combat that, a lot of people have to rely on audio transcriptions and captions. You can use an online transcription service or transcribe the audio files yourself for better user accessibility.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Fast moving images:</b><br>
	Rolling and flickering images, rapid flashes of different colors and quickly alternating patterns can trigger seizures for people ith photosensitive epilepsy. People who also are disturbed by light exposure can experience headaches, nausea, dizziness, etc. One of the biggest way to prevent this is to consider using trigger warning wherever it is applicable on your website.  </p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Ambiguous Links: </b><br> The use of ambiguous text for links like 'read more' or 'click' makes it harder for screen readers to navigate the web page. Screen reader users normally navigate from link to link, and if the text is vague, it does not provide the user with the link's context and where it will take them. One way to fix this issue is to use informative text providing details about the landing page of the link.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Non-labeled forms: </b><br>
	Another issue that screen users face is empty form labels. If that is the case, the screen reader will not be able to translate what kind of information the form is asking the user input, and it ends up looking like the empty white boxes you encountered during this mystery. You can make your forms for user friendly by using the label tag in your code for every field.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Lack of Alt Text: </b><br> As someone who is a photgraphy editor at a news outlet, a lot of my job is writing appropriate Alt Text for our multimedia coverage. Visually impaired people rely on this alt text to understand what is in the image, so it is crucial to write this text and make sure it is correct. The last two images you saw were an actual view of how visually impaired people see images they encounter online.</p><br><br>
